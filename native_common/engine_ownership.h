// one per process while the plugin runs once per engine: both plugins
// include this header from native_common/ (see their CMakeLists.txt).
//
// The first engine to enable owns the session until it disables or
// detaches. Another engine's enable is refused, and its updates, disable
// and detach change nothing. OS commands go to the owner's sink, whichever
// engine listened last. A Hot Restart keeps the engine, so its new VM's
// calls are the owner's. Android (EngineOwnership.kt) and Apple
// (MediaSessionPlugin.swift) follow the same rule, and
// test/media_session/cpp/engine_ownership_test.cc runs its table.
//
// An engine is a non-null pointer unique to it, its plugin or channel. Sink
// is a pointer type: a null one means no sink. Platform thread only.
