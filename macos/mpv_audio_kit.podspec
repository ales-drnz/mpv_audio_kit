# libmpv on macOS is distributed as a dynamic .xcframework downloaded
# from GitHub Releases as a zip. The single slice macos-<arches>/
# libmpv.framework wraps the dylib (install_name
# @rpath/libmpv.framework/libmpv); the Dart side loads it via
# DynamicLibrary.open('libmpv.framework/libmpv').
#
# A Flutter plugin ships both dependency-manager manifests — this podspec
# (CocoaPods) and Package.swift (Swift Package Manager) — and the consuming
# app's setup decides which one Flutter uses. Both describe the same
# libmpv.xcframework and share its SHA-256.
