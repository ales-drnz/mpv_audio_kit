///
/// - A new [load] cancels the one in flight: skipping through tracks
///   leaves one download running, not one per track.
/// - A load ends at [timeLimit] whatever the server does. The timeouts of
///   the download are between two steps, and a server that sends a little
///   every few seconds passes them forever.
/// - The last [capacity] covers are kept, within [byteBudget] in all, so
///   going back to the previous track loads nothing. A failure is not
///   kept: whoever asked decides when to try again.
