// The transport axis of a player as a pure state machine: the load epoch,
// the loads in flight, the play-pause intent across the calls that set it,
// the file starts and the park generation. Each input returns the effects
// the player then carries out, so the rules run without a core, and a
// stateful test drives them against a model (transport_machine_test).

/// generation first ([takePark]). A call takes it after the reply of its
/// moving command (a seek, `playlist-play-index`, a load), which mpv queues
/// ahead of the move's own event, so the take is the generation that
