/// Recovers libmpv handles leaked across a Flutter Hot-Restart.
///
/// Flutter replaces the Dart VM but keeps the parent process alive,
/// so handles allocated by the previous VM stay open (and block
/// exclusive-mode audio devices like WASAPI) until the process exits.
/// The tracker keeps the live handle addresses in a native buffer and
/// publishes the buffer in a variable of the process environment
/// ([envName]), with the pid. On startup the new VM finds the buffer
/// there and surfaces every still-tracked handle to the caller's
/// cleanup callback.
///
/// The environment lives and dies with the process, like the buffer:
/// a new process never sees the value of an old one, and nothing is
/// left on disk. A child process inherits the value with the pid of
/// its parent, and ignores it.
///
/// The pid does not tell a Hot-Restart from a second VM of the same
/// process that is still running (a second Flutter engine, an isolate
/// that calls `ensureInitialized`). The buffer holds the native port of
/// the VM that owns it, alive as long as that VM: a VM that finds the
/// owner alive takes none of its handles, and tracks none of its own.
///
/// **Debug only**: guarded by [kHotRestartPossible]. Profile and
/// release builds have no Hot-Restart. An engine can still go while the
/// process stays (Android): the players of an isolate that exits are
/// stopped by `OwnerWatch`, not here.
///
/// **Single-isolate**: [add] and [remove] are not synchronized across
/// isolates that share a pid, and only the VM that owns the buffer
/// writes to it. The test suite disables the tracker via
/// `MpvAudioKit.ensureInitialized(hotRestartCleanup: false)`.
