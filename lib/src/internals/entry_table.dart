/// An entry holds at most one resource, with its own policy:
/// - a live source ends as soon as the entry leaves the playlist, unless
///   another entry holds it: nothing reads it again;
/// - a release (the descriptor behind an `fd://` URI, which mpv never
///   closes and reads again on every open of the entry) runs once a file

///   or failed): the stream on its way out and a prefetch of the entry may
///   still read it until then;
/// - an entry with only its [Media] holds nothing.
///
/// One rule tells that an entry left: a playlist taken after mpv added the
/// entry does not list it. mpv numbers the entries in order, so a report
/// that lists the entry, or a newer one, was taken after it was added.
/// When no report can tell yet whether an entry with a live source left
/// (the observation merges changes: a stop right after the load), the
/// table reads the playlist again: a read issued after the entry was added
/// tells it too.
///
/// An external track (`audio-add`) belongs to the file it was added to:
/// mpv closes its stream when that file ends, before it reports the end
/// (END_FILE). So its release runs at the first file end after mpv took
