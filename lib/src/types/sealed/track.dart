/// enums can't model. Use the [auto] / [off] static fields and the
/// [id] factory at call-site:
///
/// ```dart
/// await player.setAudioTrack(Track.auto);
/// await player.setAudioTrack(Track.off);
/// await player.setAudioTrack(Track.id(2));
/// ```

  /// default-flagged track, or the first audio track if none is
  /// flagged). Equivalent to mpv's `aid=auto`.

  /// Disable audio output entirely. Equivalent to mpv's `aid=no`.
  /// Useful for files where the consumer wants only metadata / cover
  /// art without playing audio.

  /// Select the audio track with the given mpv [trackId]. IDs match
  /// `MpvTrack.id` entries in `PlayerState.tracks`.
