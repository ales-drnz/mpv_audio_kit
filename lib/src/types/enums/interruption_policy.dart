/// How the player reacts when the OS interrupts audio: a phone call,

/// (audio focus). macOS, Linux and Windows have no per-app audio session,
/// so the policy is a no-op there; the OS arbitrates routing itself.

  /// On iOS this also asks the system not to pre-empt playback for
  /// incidental alerts. A headphone unplug still pauses (Apple HIG).

  /// Honest limits: an accepted phone or FaceTime call or Siri still
  /// takes the audio route on iOS (that cannot be overridden) and on
  /// Android 12+ the system may fade the app out when another app gains
  /// focus.

  /// Observability: because this policy never pauses, an interruption
  /// emits NO command on [PlayerStream.mediaSessionCommands].
