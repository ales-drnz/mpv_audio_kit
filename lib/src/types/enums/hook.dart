/// Lifecycle hook fired by mpv during file loading and unloading.
///
/// The closed set mirrors `process_hooks(...)` calls in mpv's
/// `player/loadfile.c` (mpv 0.41) — six phases the consumer can
/// intercept to lazily resolve a URL, attach per-file HTTP headers,
/// drive a fallback path, or react to a track boundary.
///
/// Pass to [Player.registerHook] to subscribe; the matching
/// [MpvHookEvent] arrives on [PlayerStream.hook].
///
/// ```dart
/// player.registerHook(Hook.load);
/// player.stream.hook.listen((event) async {
///   switch (event.hook) {
///     case Hook.load:
///       // Redirect the URL via stream-open-filename, attach
///       // file-local-options/http-header-fields, etc.
///     default:
///   }
///   player.continueHook(event.id); // always call, even on error
/// });
/// ```
