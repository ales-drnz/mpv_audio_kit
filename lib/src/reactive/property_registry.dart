/// reply-id integers for `mpv_observe_property`, and exposes lifecycle
/// methods used by [Player]:

/// - [observeAll]: call `mpv_observe_property` once per spec on a live mpv
///   handle.
/// - [dispatch]: route an incoming property-change event (parsed earlier on
///   the event-isolate) to the matching spec, returning the post-reduce
///   [PlayerState] or `null` if the property is not in the registry / the
///   value was deduplicated.
/// - [closeAll]: tear down the underlying [ReactiveProperty] broadcast
