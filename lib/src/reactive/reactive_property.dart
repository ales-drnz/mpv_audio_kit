/// property owns a [ReactiveProperty] of the appropriate Dart type, and the
/// property registry mutates them as raw mpv events arrive.

/// `==`) is a no-op and does not emit on the stream. This is the primary
/// reason this class exists: it removes the per-call-site burden of "did the
/// value actually change?" branching, so a setter that updates state
/// optimistically can write unconditionally and trust that streams stay
