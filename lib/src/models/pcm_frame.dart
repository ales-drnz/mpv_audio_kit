/// One PCM frame: raw post-DSP audio samples captured at the player's
/// output, before they're handed to the OS audio driver.
///
/// Emitted on [PlayerStream.pcm] at the rate configured in
/// [SpectrumSettings.emitInterval] (default ~30 Hz). Use this for
/// time-domain visualisations the FFT pipeline can't express:
/// accurate VU and peak meters, oscilloscopes, vectorscopes, custom
/// feature extractors that need raw amplitude.
///
/// A frame holds the latest audio the tap saw, up to 4096 frames per
/// channel, whatever came before: consecutive frames overlap (about
/// 60 % on [PlayerStream.pcm] at the default 33 ms), so they cannot be
/// appended one after the other into a continuous signal.
///
/// For a frequency-domain visualizer (spectrum bars, glow effects),
/// prefer [FftFrame] from [PlayerStream.fft]. The two streams
/// share the same upstream tap, so subscribing to both costs only
/// the duplicate FFT computation, not a second tap.
///
/// Example: a peak-hold VU meter:
///
/// ```dart
/// double peak = 0;
/// player.stream.pcm.listen((frame) {
///   for (final s in frame.samples) {
///     if (s.abs() > peak) peak = s.abs();
///   }
///   peak *= 0.92; // decay
///   _vuController.value = peak;
/// });
/// ```
