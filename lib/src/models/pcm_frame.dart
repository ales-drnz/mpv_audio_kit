/// One PCM frame — raw post-DSP audio samples captured at the player's
/// output, before they're handed to the OS audio driver.
///
/// Emitted on [PlayerStream.pcm] at the rate configured in
/// [SpectrumSettings.emitInterval] (default ~30 Hz). Use this for
/// time-domain visualisations the FFT pipeline can't express:
/// Audacity-style waveforms, accurate VU/peak meters, oscilloscopes,
/// vectorscopes, custom feature extractors that need raw amplitude.
///
/// For a frequency-domain visualizer (spectrum bars, glow effects),
/// prefer [FftFrame] from [PlayerStream.spectrum]. The two streams
/// share the same upstream tap, so subscribing to both costs only
/// the duplicate FFT computation, not a second tap.
///
/// Example — a peak-hold VU meter:
///
/// ```dart
/// double peak = 0;
/// player.stream.pcm.listen((frame) {
///   for (final s in frame.samples) {
///     if (s.abs() > peak) peak = s.abs();
///   }
///   peak *= 0.92; // decay
///   _vuController.value = peak;
/// });
/// ```
