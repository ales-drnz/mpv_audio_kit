/// One FFT frame — a frequency-domain snapshot of the audio currently
/// playing through the player's output.
///
/// Emitted on [PlayerStream.spectrum] at the rate configured in
/// [SpectrumSettings.emitInterval] (default ~30 Hz). Each frame carries
/// both the **raw FFT bins** (linear frequency axis, post-window
/// magnitude, post-EMA smoothing, normalised to `[0, 1]`) and the
/// **perceptual bands** (log-spaced bucketing of the bins, the visualizer
/// staple). Most callers only need [bands]; [bins] is exposed for
/// custom remappings (mel, Bark, constant-Q).
///
/// The frame is immutable and thread-safe to pass between isolates —
/// the underlying [Float32List]s are not aliased into the audio thread's
/// ring buffer; they were copied out before this object was constructed.
///
/// Example — paint a 64-bar spectrum analyzer:
///
/// ```dart
/// player.stream.spectrum.listen((frame) {
///   for (var i = 0; i < frame.bands.length; i++) {
///     final h = frame.bands[i] * canvasHeight;
///     // draw bar i with height h …
///   }
/// });
/// ```
