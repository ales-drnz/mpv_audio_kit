/// loaded source, emitted on `PlayerStream.loudness`.

/// it plays — the scan decodes the whole file off the playback path at
/// many times realtime, so the integrated loudness of the entire track is
/// known moments after the file loads. Use it to normalize playback volume
/// for tracks without ReplayGain tags:
///
/// ```dart
/// player.stream.loudness.listen((scan) {
///   if (scan?.state == LoudnessScanState.ready) {
///     final gainDb = -18.0 - scan!.integrated!; // ReplayGain 2.0 reference
///     player.setVolumeGain(gainDb.clamp(-24.0, 24.0));
///   }
/// });
/// ```

/// [LoudnessScanState.ready].
