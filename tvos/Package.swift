// The tvOS plugin, which flutter-tvos (https://fluttertv.dev) reads from
// tvos/Package.swift. Sources/ holds copies of darwin/'s, which
// test/packaging/darwin_package_test.dart keeps identical: SwiftPM takes
// no target outside the package root, and dart pub publish does not keep
// a symlink.
//
// On tvOS libmpv comes from here, not from the build hook: flutter-tvos
// runs the hook but installs none of its code assets. The package links
// libmpv_tvos.xcframework.zip of the release, which SwiftPM downloads and
// checks against `checksum`, both written by scripts/update_libmpv.sh;
// the Dart side binds it with @Native, whose symbols then resolve in the
// process. A libmpv build of your own (libmpv-scripts'
// build_libmpv_tvos.sh) placed at tvos/libmpv.xcframework is linked
// instead, like the hook's libmpv user define on the other platforms.
