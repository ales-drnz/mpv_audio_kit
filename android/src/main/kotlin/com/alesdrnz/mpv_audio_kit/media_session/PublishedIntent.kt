/**
 * The play intent the session publishes, kept free of Android types so it
 * runs on the plain JVM (see `PublishedIntentTest`).
 *
 * A transient focus loss (a call, an alarm) pauses the player and arms the
 * resume for the next gain. The session then publishes `playWhenReady`
 * with the suppression reason of a transient focus loss, as ExoPlayer
 * does, instead of a pause. Media3 keeps a session with `playWhenReady`
 * "user engaged", so the service stays in the foreground through the
 * whole call. Published as paused, it left the foreground after Media3's
 * timeout (10 minutes), and on Android 12 and later the play at the end
 * of the call could not bring it back (F172). Controllers still show the
 * play button: Media3 draws a suppressed session as paused.
