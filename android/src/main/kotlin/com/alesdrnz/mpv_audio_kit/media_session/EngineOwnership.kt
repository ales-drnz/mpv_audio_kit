/**
 * Which Flutter engine owns the process-wide media session, and the command
 * sink of each engine, kept free of Android types so it runs on the plain
 * JVM (see `EngineOwnershipTest`). An engine is any token unique to it (the
 * plugin instance attached to it), [S] the type of its sink.
 *
 * An app can run more engines than the one that plays: a workmanager task
 * builds one per task and destroys it at the end, add-to-app keeps several.
 * The first engine to enable owns the session until it disables or
 * detaches. Another engine's enable is refused, and its updates, disable
 * and detach change nothing. OS commands go to the owner's sink, whichever
 * engine listened last. A Hot Restart keeps the engine, so its new VM's
 * calls are the owner's. Apple, Windows and Linux follow the same rule.
