/**
 * Pure decision logic for OS audio interruptions, mapping an Android audio
 * focus change (or a "becoming noisy" route change) + the consumer's
 * [interruptionPolicy] into a transport reaction. Kept free of any Android
 * instance APIs (it reads only compile-time `AUDIOFOCUS_*` int constants)
 * so it is unit-testable on the plain JVM — see `InterruptionLogicTest`.
 *
 * Mirrors the Apple `AVAudioSession` behaviour in `MediaSessionPlugin.swift`:
 * - `pauseAndResume`: pause on loss; resume only after a *transient* loss
 *   that interrupted playback.
 * - `pauseOnly`: pause on loss; never auto-resume.
 * - `keepPlaying`: never auto-pause on focus loss (the system still auto-ducks).
 * A headphone unplug ("becoming noisy") always pauses, even under
 * `keepPlaying` (Apple HIG: don't blast the speaker), and never arms
 * auto-resume — re-plugging must not restart.
