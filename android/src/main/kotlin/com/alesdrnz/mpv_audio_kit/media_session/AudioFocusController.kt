/**
 * Owns Android audio-focus and the "becoming noisy" route change for the
 * media session, translating both into transport commands forwarded to
 * Dart (which drives libmpv). This is the Android counterpart to the iOS
 * `AVAudioSession` interruption handling — libmpv's `audiotrack` output
 * does NOT request focus itself, so the plugin is the sole focus owner.
 *
 * The pure policy mapping lives in [InterruptionLogic], and the Android
 * calls in [FocusPort] ([AndroidFocusPort] in the app): this class keeps
 * the state between them and applies the reactions, so a JVM test drives
 * it with a fake port. Focus callbacks are delivered on the main looper
 * and the receiver's `onReceive` runs on the main thread, so [emit]
 * (which itself hops to the platform thread) is always called on main.
