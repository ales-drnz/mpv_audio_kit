# libmpv is not part of this pod: the package's build hook
# (hook/build.dart) downloads it and Flutter bundles it with the app as
# libmpv_audio_kit.framework, a code asset the Dart side binds with @Native.
#
# A Flutter plugin ships both dependency-manager manifests, this podspec
# (CocoaPods) and mpv_audio_kit/Package.swift (Swift Package Manager), and
# the consuming app's setup decides which one Flutter uses. pubspec.yaml
# sets sharedDarwinSource, so both platforms read them from darwin/.
